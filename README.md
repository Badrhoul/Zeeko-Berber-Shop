# Zeeko-Berber-Shop
Solo Project for Codeworks: This was an application dedicated to my brother Zak. He is a Barber out of Boston, MA, and I wanted to give him a way to connect with his customers. He isn't a fan of new technology, so he often relies on giving his personal number to his clients and jotting his appointments for the day on a piece of paper. 
When I deploy this app, the idea is that any barber will be able to build thier own profile with a following of their clientele. His clients will be able to see openeings in his schedule, and Zak will be able to see what appointments he has for that day.

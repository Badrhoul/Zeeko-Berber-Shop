# Zeeko-Berber-Shop
Solo Project for Codeworks: This was an application dedicated to my brother Zak. He is a Barber out of Boston, MA, and I wanted to give him a way to connect with his customers. He isn't a fan of new technology, so he often relies on giving his personal number to his clients and jotting his appointments for the day on a piece of paper. 
When I deploy this app, the idea is that any barber will be able to build thier own profile with a following of their clientele. His clients will be able to see openeings in his schedule, and Zak will be able to see what appointments he has for that day.


# Getting started

Open the terminal and type "npm install" - This is for date formatting across the application

In the terminal navigate to the server folder and run the same command. When the dependencies installed run command "nodemon index" to start the server.

In a defferent terminal navigate to the client folder and type "npm install". When finished type "npm run dev" to launch the app.
